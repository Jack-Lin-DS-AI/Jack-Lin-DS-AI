My name is Chih-Hsu Lin. You can call me Jack.  
I am a senior data scientist at [C3.ai](https://c3.ai) (NYSE: AI) in the San Francisco Bay Area.  
I love data and have won 🏆top 3%-6% in 3 Kaggle competitions (top 2.9% of active users).  
I received a 🎓PhD degree with quantitative concentration.  
During my 3-month internship in a top-tier biotech company, Illumina (with >7,000 employees), I not only reduced 94% time of manual curation by machine learning pipeline, I also led a 11-person team to win 🏆 the 1st place in business case competition.

❓Problem (multiclass classification): How to classify 1,108 treatments based on the images of 4 different cell types?  
🤔Why it's important: Accurate and precise image classification can expedite the drug discovery process and improve the understanding of drug effects on cells.  
📝What I did:  I built a deep learning pipeline using state of the art convolutional neural networks to achieved accuracy of 0.97757.  
💡Findings: Different cell types have pretty distinct images so the cell type-specific models are necessary.  
📂Data type: image of 6 channels  
🛠️Skills: PyTorch, data augmentation, image processing, convolutional neural networks  

4. Accelerating Variant Triaging by Machine Learning. 2019. <a href="https://www.illumina.com/"><img height="25" src="https://github.com/Jack-Lin-DS-AI/Jack-Lin-DS-AI/blob/main/pic/illumina3.jpg?raw=true"></a> internship.  
❓Problem (classification): How to predict the clinically relevant variants to automate the triaging process?  
🤔Why it's important: Successful predictions can reduce turn around time and provide timely information to facilitate clinical decisions.  
📝What I did: I parsed json files and converted them to tabular data. I cleaned and merged internal data with external data. I developed a machine learning pipeline to reduce the manual time by 94%. I presented the results as a poster at an international annual conference (8,500 attendees, ~250 exhibiting companies).  
💡Findings: communication is the key to customize the pipeline to colleagues' needs and existing frameworks.  
📂Data type: json and tabular data + external data collection and cleaning
